			<p>This tool performs a counterpoint analysis on the musical
				"voices" within a MIDI file. A MIDI file contains information about
				the musical notes played at specific times. For example, it might
				specify that a certain Bb occurs at such and such time in a piece of
				music, and a certain F# occurs at other specific times. Although
				MIDI is not an audio file format, MIDI files represent when specific
				notes should be played. People can play MIDI files on a computer and
				on many electronic keyboards.</p>
			<p>In music theory, "counterpoint" refers to the analysis of how
				musical "voices," or distinct parts or lines, interact with and
				relate to each other. For example, how does a trumpet part relate to
				a trombone part, how does a violin part relate to a cello part, or
				how does a soprano line relate to an alto line? These are the kinds
				of questions that counterpoint analysis seeks to answer.</p>
			<p>
				When two voices play at the same time, they can move in various
				directions relative to each other. The four types of contrapuntal
				motion are similar, parallel, oblique, and contrary. If they both
				move in the same direction, they are said to have <u>"similar"</u>
				motion. If they both move in the same direction with the same
				distance (or "interval"), they have <u>"parallel"</u> motion. If one
				voice remains the same while the other moves up or down, the motion
				between the two voices is <u>"oblique."</u> And if the two voices
				move in opposite directions, they exhibit <u>"contrary"</u> motion
				in that place.
